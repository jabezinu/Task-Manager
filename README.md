# Task Manager Backend

This is the backend for the **Task Manager** project, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. It provides a RESTful API for managing tasks, including creating, reading, updating, and deleting tasks.

> **Note:** I have also started working on a React-based frontend for this project as an extra feature, but due to time constraints, it is still a work in progress.

## Features

- Create, read, update, and delete tasks
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- CORS enabled for frontend integration
- Simple and clean API structure


## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/jabezinu/Task-Manager
   cd backend
   npm install
   npm run dev


   you can test the backend it is fully functional also i was trying to make the frontend but my time limits me

   Thank you
